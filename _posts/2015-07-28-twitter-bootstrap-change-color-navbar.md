Really quick article about a cool tool.

Few weeks ago I had to change my navbar colors and could not be bothered going through all the CSS files to modify all the colors etc...

I found [this awesome and really simple website] [1]

Just select your colors and then it will generate all the CSS classes you need to implement to modify your colors.
You need to add the generated CSS to your CSS file and then apply `navbar-custom` class to your navbar and colors will change as you set it up!

Hope this helps!
