It has been a while I didn't post. Sorry, I got busy with my new job.

Thanks to this new job, I had to learn AngularJS. I must say I'm really surprised and happy about it!

It's for this same job that I had to do a checkAll/uncheckAll functionnality. I found this page: [http://dotnetpanda.blogspot.co.nz/2013/12/lets-do-check-all-and-uncheck-all.html][1]

I tried to apply it but it wasn't working for me...

Found out that it's because this version is only compatible with AngularJS 1.1 but once you are on AngularJS 1.2 and above it doesn't work.

You can find my version, compatible with AngularJS 1.2 (but not with prior versions which is... weird...) on this JSfiddle: [http://jsfiddle.net/vatweb/g1Lem3Lw/] [2]
