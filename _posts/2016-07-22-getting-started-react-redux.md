Sorry for not posting recently, I have been really busy at work and on personal projects :)

It gave me some awesome time working on React apps using the very powerful Redux package.

I have been collecting some really useful articles about Redux and I will just share all of them here:

## Some beginner reading

- Get to know the pros and cons of working with Redux in your ReactJS app: [https://www.madetech.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-react-plus-redux] [1]

- A global full stack tutorial about Redux. Very well explained and complete. [http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html] [2]

- A masterpiece by egghead.io: [https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux] [3]

- A fairly complete article about what tools do you need, how your app should be organised, etc. 
[https://medium.com/@tkssharma/react-redux-best-practices-write-production-apps-7c3639e3c447] [10]

## Once you nailed it

- 3 simple steps to improve your React Redux code: [https://www.ckl.io/blog/3-simple-steps-to-improve-react-redux-code/] [4]

- A very very useful post about some lessons learned after months of Redux development. I totally agree with #2, #3, #4. 
[https://medium.com/@royisch/6-lessons-learned-from-going-to-production-with-react-redux-19257f6724f6] [5]

## Get some exercise

- I created this small repo on Github to give a quick intro and easy walk through a React/Redux app. First exercise is complete, then you have to fill the gaps :) [https://github.com/springload/react-redux-exercise] [6]

N.B.: Solutions are encoded in base64 so you don't get too tempted to look at them directly :)

Feel free to [contact me] [9] if you have any suggestions about this repo.

## Twitter

Twitter is an excellent source of knowledge. I almost found all these articles on it.

I highly recommend following [@JavascriptDaily] [7] who's always sharing some very valuable articles about javascript in general and sometimes about React and Redux in particular.

You can also follow me on Twitter [@vatweb] [8]. I usually tweet all the little gems I find while keeping my knowledge up to date.


Have A LOT of fun with Redux!
